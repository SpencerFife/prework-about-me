      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>For several years now, I've been a baker in the food industry. Since I was young I've had a passion for technology whether it be editing videos on my computer or playing games with friends. Now I want to learn the "nuts and bolts" of those programs that've caught my attention for so long.</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>Seattle, WA</p>

      <p>Drawing, reading, playing games (board and video).</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>Art design for either comics or video games.</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>

      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>Web design and programming seem to be a skill that is more necessary in our time, and I recognise how important gaining and applying these skills are. Besides, learning a new skill is always fun.</p>
